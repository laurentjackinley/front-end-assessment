        <header>Interest</header>
        <p>I think I can say I'm a person with a lot of interests, and one of them is soccer it has been my favorite sport for years now, and I play every weekend with friends and family. I like to listen to music which I don't have a type that I want, I listen to everything as long I like the music, I like to play video games, especially the simulation type game, and soon coding will be on top of that list.</p>

    <p>My goal is to become a Sofware Engineer, After I completed the web dev program, and I get a job just to get some experience, I will continue my education to get a degree in Sofware Engineering, which is my dream. Since I was a kid I was always interested in tech, and I think this is the time to achieve it..</p>
